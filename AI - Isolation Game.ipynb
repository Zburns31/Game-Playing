    "The rules of 3 Snails Isolation are a variation of the original Isolation. In the original form of the game there are two players, each with their own game piece, and a 7-by-7 grid of squares. At the beginning of the game, the first player places their piece on any square. The second player follows suit, and places their piece on any one of the available squares. From that point on, the players alternate turns moving their piece like a queen in chess (any number of open squares vertically, horizontally, or diagonally). When the piece is moved, the square that was previously occupied is blocked, and cannot be used for the remainder of the game. The first player who is unable to move their queen loses.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this 3 Snails variant, each player controls 3 pieces (\"snails\"), each of which can only move to 1 surrounding square, either to the left/right or directly above/below it. Once a piece moves away from a square, no other piece can occupy the square again, as in the original Isolation game. For clarity, examine the scenario below:\n",
    "\n",
    "In the image below, both Q1 and Q2 place their snails on the board. Note, that when choosing your move, you must ensure your moves are selected in proper order\n",

    "In the image below, Q1 is in the process of choosing its next set of moves. It has chosen 2 moves already, which are printed in the output box, and still needs to pick where \"13\" will move. Note that the possible moves for any given piece is either to the left/down or directly above/below it.\n",

    "Q1 makes its move and Q2 has already chosen the next set of moves. In the image below, Q2 tried to move two of its snails to the same location. Such moves are illegal, as indicated by the message in the output box.\n",

    "---------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "As the game board in Isolation is fully viewable by both players at all times, the game is fully observable, adversarial, and deterministic. This allows the development of an AI-based game playing agent using suitable algorithms and heuristics, including Minimax\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Minimax Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "Minimax is a decision-making algorithm, **typically used in a turn-based, two player games**. The goal of the algorithm is to find the optimal next move\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Idea:** Choose move to position with highest minimax value = best achievable payoff against best play\n",
    "- **Perfect (optimal) play for deterministic, perfect-information games**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Minimax Algorithm Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "- In the algorithm, one player is called the maximizer, and the other  player is a minimizer. If we assign an evaluation score to the game board, one player tries to choose a game state with the maximum score, while the other chooses a state with the minimum score\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- In other words, the **maximizer works to get the highest score, while the minimizer tries get the lowest score** by trying to counter moves\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- It is based on the [zero-sum game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-sum_game) concept. **In a zero-sum game, the total utility score is divided among the players. An increase in one player's score results into the decrease in another  player's score.** So, the total score is always zero. For one  player to win, the other one has to lose. Examples of such games are chess, poker, checkers, tic-tac-toe\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- We traverse the game tree ***depth-first*** until we reach the terminal nodes and assign their parent node a value that is best for the player whose turn it is to move. For example, the game tree of a game of tic-tac-toe looks like:\n",
